# init-wizard (Project Initializer CLI)

#### Description
Project Initializer CLI is a command-line tool designed to help developers quickly set up and configure new or existing React or Node.js projects. It provides an interactive prompt that guides users through the process of adding TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and TailwindCSS to their projects. The CLI ensures that all necessary configurations and dependencies are installed and set up correctly, making it easier for developers to maintain consistent code quality and style across their projects.

#### Features
- **Interactive Prompts:** Guides users through the setup process with easy-to-follow questions.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Adds TypeScript support to your project.
- **ESLint Configuration:** Sets up ESLint for code linting and quality assurance.
- **Prettier Setup:** Integrates Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- **Husky & Lint-Staged:** Configures Husky and Lint-Staged for pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before commits.
- **TailwindCSS Installation:** Optionally adds TailwindCSS for utility-first CSS framework support.

**NOTE:** init-wizard assumes you are currently using `npm` as package manager. We are adding compatibility for `pnpm`, `yarn` etc in later versions soon.

#### Usage

To initialize a new or existing project, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
npx init-wizard@latest
```

#### Example

$ npx init-wizard@latest
